# The problem

Have you ever needed to mark specific locations on a custom map image? Maybe you’re designing a game, planning an event, or documenting key points on a historical map. Doing this manually—tracking coordinates and saving them separately—is tedious and inefficient. Wouldn't it be great if there were an easy way to place markers interactively and get their exact locations in a structured format?
